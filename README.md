# Plexito
Plexito is a mini player for Plex, on Windows, which allows you to use your Multimedia Keys even if Plex is not the current active window

##Current Limitations:

+ Limited support - No _Plex Home_
+ No UI to enter username / password: use plex.config
+ No encryption of credentials: Sorry, as of now, plex.config contains password inplain text :(
+ No UI to select the player to control : plex.config needs to be edited manually with the user-unfriendly playerId.
